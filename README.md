# Advent of Code 2024 Personal Solutions
This repository serves to hold my progress in completing the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024 "Advent of Code 2024 Homepage") problems in anticipation of preparing/refreshing myself on Python for my Advanced Python class at WVC.

Typical format for each day includes two sets of data, `data1.txt` and `data2.txt`. `data1` holds a smaller example set of data to test against, while `data2` holds the actual problem data to be used for submission. `solution.py` is the Python script run to get the problem solution.
