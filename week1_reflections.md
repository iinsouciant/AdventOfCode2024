# Week 1 Reflections
I have hardly used polymorphism, inheritance, or encapsulation when working on solo projects amd creating a code base from scratch. Lecture has reminded me what each of them are and their purpose.
### Polymorphism and Inheritance
Polymorphism is the ability to treat ojects of different classes in a similar way. Inheritance provides the attributes and methods of the parent class to the child class.
Wikipedia provides an example of the two by giving an a parent class a placeholder method to be overwritten by a child class. Multiple types of child classes are then created to override that placeholder method with their own unique method.
### Encapsulation
Encapsulation was described as making it so a class acts like a black box for the user to reduce complexity and improve ease of use. From my recollection in previous classes, this can sort of be achieved through dunder naming, but it will not be to the same level as Java or C++.
